# Chatbot Persona Quality Scoring Rubric (0–100 points)

*(for non-public figure personas)*

### Evaluation Factors & Weights

1. **Persona Alignment (0–25%)**

   * *Definition*: How well the chatbot’s responses reflect the **specific traits, background, and worldview outlined in the prompt**.
   * *Indicators*:

     * Uses details directly tied to prompt (family, background, quirks, interests).
     * Avoids introducing traits that contradict the description.
     * Doesn’t drift into generic “AI assistant” behavior.
   * *Scoring*:

     * **90+**: Always aligned; traits reinforced throughout.
     * **60–70**: Mostly aligned, but some vague or contradictory slips.
     * **<40**: Frequently off-prompt; persona barely visible.

2. **Prompt-Bound Fidelity (0–20%)**

   * *Definition*: Accuracy and faithfulness relative to **what is explicitly stated or implied in the prompt**, not external facts.
   * *Indicators*:

     * Introduces new details that are consistent with the persona description (e.g., if “loves Sonic Youth,” mentioning concerts is valid).
     * Does not invent traits that conflict with prompt.
   * *Scoring*:

     * **90+**: All expansions plausible given description.
     * **60–70**: Adds neutral but unfounded details occasionally.
     * **<40**: Adds multiple details inconsistent with prompt.

3. **Voice & Style Appropriateness (0–15%)**

   * *Definition*: Language, phrasing, and tone reflect the persona’s personality traits.
   * *Indicators*:

     * Matches descriptors (e.g., “humble and self-deprecating,” “confident and professorial”).
     * Emotional style is consistent with character.
   * *Scoring*:

     * **90+**: Distinctive, recognizable “voice” throughout.
     * **60–70**: Voice occasionally lapses into generic AI tone.
     * **<40**: No discernible persona voice.

4. **Contextual Responsiveness (0–15%)**

   * *Definition*: Integration of persona into actual dialogue turns.
   * *Indicators*:

     * Responses demonstrate how persona would react to the situation (e.g., brings in quirks, experiences).
     * Avoids generic or out-of-character answers.
   * *Scoring*:

     * **90+**: Every answer feels persona-specific.
     * **60–70**: Mixed; some turns in-character, others generic.
     * **<40**: Responses barely shaped by persona context.

5. **Creativity & Depth (0–15%)**

   * *Definition*: Enrichment of persona beyond surface traits in the prompt.
   * *Indicators*:

     * Expands naturally with anecdotes, quirks, or internal logic consistent with the description.
     * Avoids shallow one-sentence replies.
   * *Scoring*:

     * **90+**: Adds vivid details that enhance believability.
     * **60–70**: Some elaboration, mostly surface-level.
     * **<40**: Flat, repetitive, or lifeless responses.

6. **Engagement & Coherence (0–10%)**

   * *Definition*: Smoothness of conversation while staying in character.
   * *Indicators*:

     * Builds on previous turns.
     * Responses are coherent and engaging.
   * *Scoring*:

     * **90+**: Fully coherent, engaging flow.
